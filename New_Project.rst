Creating a New Project
************************

In the ROSVITA main development environment, by clicking on the blue-highlighted **Xamla** icon in the upper left corner, 
a selection bar appears, in which you select the menu item **New Project**.
Alternatively, you can also click on **New Project** directly in the middle of the start screen.
A text box appears in which you can enter the desired name of the project (see Fig. 2.1).

.. note:: Enter a name without a path here, as the path under which the project is saved is already specified in the ROSVITA start script.

After clicking on the **Create** button, the project is created and opened in the **Configuration View** of ROSVITA.
Moreover, the project folder is opened in the integrated file browser on the left.

On your local host machine, you will find the project folder you just created under the path ``/home/<username>/Rosvita/projects/``.
So far it contains only empty folders or files with empty structures that will be filled later on (see Fig. 2.2).

Now, we are ready for creating a new robot configuration within our just created project.
