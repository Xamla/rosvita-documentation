# ROSVITA Documentation
This is the documentation of the ROSVITA robot programming environment.

To build this documentation first install [Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/). 
Assuming you have Python already, install Sphinx via the following command:

``pip install sphinx sphinx-autobuild``

Moreover, install the [Read the Docs Sphinx Theme](https://github.com/rtfd/sphinx_rtd_theme) via:

``pip install sphinx_rtd_theme``

Next, clone this repository: ``git clone https://github.com/Xamla/rosvita-documentation.git``. <br />
Then go into folder "rosvita-documentation" and type the command ``make html``. <br />
A folder "_build" will appear. 
Go into this folder and there, into the folder "html".
There you'll find a file "index.html". 
Open this file with e.g. "Chrome" and you'll see the beginning of the ROSVITA documentation and links to all chapters of the current documentation.
