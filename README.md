# rosvita-documentation
Documentation of the ROSVITA robot programming environment.

Sphinx is a tool that makes it easy to create beautiful documentation. 
Assuming you have Python already, install Sphinx:

``pip install sphinx sphinx-autobuild``

Next, clone this repository: ``git clone https://github.com/Xamla/rosvita-documentation.git``. <br />
Then go into folder "rosvita-documentation" and type the command ``make html``. <br />
A folder "_build" will appear. 
Go into this folder and there, into the folder "html".
There you'll find a file "index.html". 
Open this file with e.g. "Chrome" and you'll see the beginning of the ROSVITA documentation and links to all chapters of the current documentation.

This is work in progress!
