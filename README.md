# rosvita-documentation
Documentation of the ROSVITA robot programming environment.

Clone this repository, go into folder "rosvita-documentation" and type the command ``make html``. <br />
A folder "_build" will appear. 
Go into this folder and there, into the folder "html".
There you'll find a file "index.html". 
Open this file with e.g. "Chrome" and you'll see the beginning of the ROSVITA documentation and links to all chapters of the current documentation.

This is work in progress!
